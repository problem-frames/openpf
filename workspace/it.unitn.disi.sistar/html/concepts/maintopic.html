<h1>Tropos</h1>
Tropos proposes a software development methodology founded on concepts used to model 
early requirements.<br/> 
In particular, the proposal adopts Eric Yu's i* modeling framework, which offers the 
notions of actor, goal and (actor) dependency, and uses these as a foundation to model 
early and late requirements, architectural and detailed design. The methodology 
complements proposals for agent-oriented programming platforms.<br/>
