Compilation

- Edit flags at beginning of walksat.c to change the following
options:

    Exactly one of the following should be defined to be 1, 
    the rest defined to be 0:
	UNIX (Most versions of Unix, including Linux)
        NT   (Microsoft Windows)
	OSX  (Macintosh version of Unix)
        ANSI (Ansi Unix, use only if will not compile under Unix)

    Following may be defined at your option:	

	DYNAMIC - use dynamic arrays
        MAXATOM - if static arrays used, must set
        MAXCLAUSE - if static arrays used, must set
	_WATCH - enable watched literal speedup hack by Alex Fukunaga;
		significantly increases speed, but incompatible with
		dynamic arrays

- For Windows, create a workspace/project and add the library
Winmm.lib to the "linker" tab.

Compilation options:
	make           # compile everything
	make install   # compile and copy to $USER/bin
	make clean     # remove .o files

Walksat specifications

Walksat attempts to find a satisfying model of a cnf formula.
Format is .cnf format:


c Optional comments at start of file.
c The "p" line specifies cnf format, number vars, number clauses
c Variables are numbered starting at 1
c Each clause ends with 0
p cnf 3 2
1 -3 0
2 3 -1 0

Walksat reads from standard in and writes to standard out (and
standard error).  To get a list of command line options, type
	walksat -help
(or any other illegal option).

*****************************************************************

Also included in distribution:

makecnf [-seed N] [-cnf] [-f] [-kf] clen nvars nclauses

Generate random formulas using the fixed clause length model.
The -seed argument can be used to initialize the random number
generator.  The -cnf, -f, and -kf options specify the format of the
wff file; for walksat use -cnf.  Clen is the length of each clause,
nvars the number of variables, and nclauses the number of clauses.

makequeens N

Generate a N-queens formula.

HISTORY

version 7 - introduced breakcount[] array
version 11 - if all vars in a clause are tabu, pick another clause
version 14 - universal sequence
version 16 - improved print options and help message
version 17 - added trace N option
version 18 - added avg # unsat in tail
version 19 - fixed bug in calc. of avg # unsat in tail
version 21 - fixed help message
version 22 - used POSIX times() function
version 23 - calculate std dev of avgfalse in tail
version 25 - -hamming option
version 26 - simplified inner loop
version 27 - major cleanup, reorganized distribution file
version 28 - novelty and rnovelty heuristics
version 30 - fixed bug in calcuation of mean restarts, and added:
		novelty, rnovelty, noise calculations
version 31 - fix divide by 0 core dump
version 32 - fix bug in tabu code
version 33 - print mean flips until assign after each try.
version 34 - allow numsol to work with solcnf 
version 35 - fixed printing of columns
version 36 - adjusted formatting of output
version 37 - cleaned up, Makefile for gcc, option of printing 
		solution to a file, fixed bugs in -target option
version 38 - added rnovelty+; but performance is poor on random 3 sat
		formulas, contrary to expectations from H. Hoos;
		paper; some detail of implementation may be critical!
version 39 - fixed, should be novelty+, not rnovelty+.
version 40 - compiles now under NT, ansi unix, as well as most other Unix's
version 41 - uses long long ints for cutoff
version 42 - fixed bug in rnovelty when demoninator not 100
version 43 - finally included CORRECT versions of novelty+ and rnovelty+.
version 44 - special version for sat competition - not distributed
version 45 - speedup by Alex Fukunaga <fukunaga@CS.UCLA.EDU>, see below
version 46 - fixed timing calculations
version 47 - fixes printing long long ints
