scripts for the development:

install.sh -- install the IDE 

pf-3.6.1.sh -- install the 3.6.1 product
pf-3.6.sh -- install the 3.6 product
pf.sh -- the common script shared by the above two

recover.sh -- recover the git repository to the previous SVN checkout if it was broken: use with caution as it is safer to checkout the SVN on separate folder then copy the local changes over.

openome-checkout.sh -- checkout OpenOME source code
