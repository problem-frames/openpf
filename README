 == User's Manual == 

 * Click at the toolbar button with an icon showing multiple paint frames, 
   a new project Examples will be created
   * Open > Generate Example Project
 * Select a file with ".pf" extension under the Examples project folder
	* You can also create your own problem frames by either editing a file
	  with the ".pf" extension, or 
	* by creating a new diagram using the Problem Diagram editor
 * Select a file with ".istar" extension under the Examples project folder
	* You can also create your own i* diagrams by either editing a file
	  with the ".istar" extension, or 
	* by creating a new diagram using the OpenOME editor
 * Edit:
	* The syntax highlighting text editor makes sure you are entering a
	  valid problem diagram textually. If you save the text, a diagram will 
	  be created
 	* Inside the graphical editor, edit the name and description of the domains by clicking and editing
		* You can also open up the properties editor (right click) to change the domain types
		* You can edit any node as a subproblem diagram using double click at the node
 * Save when you are using the text editor
    * If it is saved from the .pf editor
	 * The file with ".problem" extension will be generated for the EMF model
	 * The file with ".problem_diagram" extension will be generated for the GMF diagram
	 * If the diagram file already exists, a SaveAs dialog will prompt you to avoid overwrite it
    * If it is saved from the .istar editor
	 * The file with ".oom" extension will be generated for the EMF model of OpenOME
	 * The file with ".ood" extension will be generated for the GMF diagram of OpenOME
	 * If the diagram file already exists, a SaveAs dialog will prompt you to avoid overwrite it

 == Developer's Manual ==

 * To develop OpenPF/OpenOME inside the Eclipse IDE, you need the following steps:
  * checkout both the code for openpf and openome:
    git svn clone -r HEAD https://computing-research.open.ac.uk/repos/openpf/trunk openpf
    git svn clone -r HEAD https://se.cs.toronto.edu/svn/trac/ome/trunk/workspace ../openome-workspace
	* Note for the checkout access, please ask Jennifer Horkoff <mailto:jenhork@cs.utoronto.ca> at the
	  University of Toronto to get the permission
	* Note if you are using a proxy server, to check out the code need to change the configuration file 
          ~/.subversion/servers, for example:
[global]
http-proxy-host = wwwcache.open.ac.uk
http-proxy-port = 80

  * Install an compatible Eclipse Modeling Tools IDE
    Helios (Linux or the platform of your choice such as macosx-cocoa or win32)
    download eclipse-modeling-helios-incubation-linux-gtk.tar.gz
  * In the Help menu, select Install Modeling Components > xtext text-to-model and Acceleo model-to-text components
  * Run Eclipse
    The following menu/dialog options are needed to build the system
    * import the projects from the workspace
      File > Import ... >  General > Existing Projects into the workspace > Next > Browse > OK > Finish
	* You may unselect PF2EC project as it is meant to be used inside a running OpenPF environment
    * change the compiler settings for the restricted API usages
      Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings > Deprecated and restricted API > 
      Forbidden references (access rules) > Error => Warning > OK > Yes
    * Select the following features from Help > Install Modeling component
	Acceleo
	Xtext 
	GMF
  * open and run the product:
    Project Explorer > problem > Double click at the pf.product file > Testing > Launch an Eclipse Application

 == Maintainer's Manual ==
  * Run the headless script:
    cd build.x86_64
    build.sh 
  * It is now continously integrated (any svn commit of the workspace will trigger a rebuilt of the binaries)

Enjoy,
