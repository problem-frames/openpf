 == User's Manual == 

 * Click at the toolbar button with an icon showing multiple paint frames, 
   a new project Examples will be created
   * Open > Generate Example Project
 * Select a file with ".pf" extension under the Examples project folder
	* You can also create your own problem frames by either editing a file
	  with the ".pf" extension, or 
	* by creating a new diagram using the Problem Diagram editor
 * Select a file with ".istar" extension under the Examples project folder
	* You can also create your own i* diagrams by either editing a file
	  with the ".istar" extension, or

	  valid problem diagram textually. If you save the text, a diagram will 
	  be created
 	* Inside the graphical editor, edit the name and description of the domains by clicking and editing
		* You can also open up the properties editor (right click) to change the domain types
		* You can edit any node as a subproblem diagram using double click at the node
 * Save when you are using the text editor
    * If it is saved from the .pf editor
	 * The file with ".problem" extension will be generated for the EMF model
	 * The file with ".problem_diagram" extension will be generated for the GMF diagram
	 * If the diagram file already exists, a SaveAs dialog will prompt you to avoid overwrite it
    * If it is saved from the .istar editor
	 * The file with ".oom" extension will be generated for the EMF model of OpenOME

 == Developer's Manual ==

 * To develop OpenPF/OpenOME inside the Eclipse IDE, you need the following steps:
  * checkout both the code for openpf and openome:
    git svn clone -r HEAD https://computing-research.open.ac.uk/repos/openpf/trunk openpf
    git svn clone -r HEAD https://se.cs.toronto.edu/svn/trac/ome/trunk/workspace ../openome-workspace
	* Note for the checkout access, please ask Jennifer Horkoff <mailto:jenhork@cs.utoronto.ca> at the
	  University of Toronto to get the permission
	* Note if you are using a proxy server, to check out the code need to change the configuration file 
          ~/.subversion/servers, for example:
[global]
http-proxy-host = wwwcache.open.ac.uk
http-proxy-port = 80

  * Install an compatible Eclipse Modeling Tools IDE
    Helios (Linux or the platform of your choice such as macosx-cocoa or win32)
    download eclipse-modeling-helios-incubation-linux-gtk.tar.gz
  * In the Help menu, select Install Modeling Components > xtext text-to-model and Acceleo model-to-text components
  * Run Eclipse
    The following menu/dialog options are needed to build the system
    * import the projects from the workspace
      File > Import ... >  General > Existing Projects into the workspace > Next > Browse > OK > Finish
	* You may unselect PF2EC project as it is meant to be used inside a running OpenPF environment
    * change the compiler settings for the restricted API usages
      Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings > Deprecated and restricted API > 
      Forbidden references (access rules) > Error => Warning > OK > Yes
    * update the SWTBot library:
      Help > Install New Software >  Enter http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/galileo/dev-build/update-site >
      Select the following features:
  SWTBot for Eclipse Testing (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.feature.group
  SWTBot for GEF Testing (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.gef.feature.group
  SWTBot for SWT Testing (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.feature.group
  SWTBot IDE Features (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.ide.feature.group
  SWTBot JUnit 3.x Headless launchers for Eclipse (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.test.junit3.feature.group
  SWTBot JUnit 4.x Headless launchers for Eclipse (incubation) org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.test.junit4.feature.group
      Next > Accept the licenses > Finish > Yes to restart Eclipse
    * update the antlr library: 
      Help > Install New Software >  Enter http://download.itemis.com/updates >
Select the following feature:
  Xtext Antlr Support 0.7.2	
      Next > Accept the licenses > Finish > Yes to restart Eclipse
        * Warning: If you haven't installed this feature, there might be two
          compilation errors related to the missing org.eclipse.xtext.log4j
	  plugin library. It is included because xtext code generator requires
          the Antlr parser generator.
  * open and run the product:
    Project Explorer > problem > Double click at the pf.product file > Testing > Launch an Eclipse Application

 == Maintainer's Manual ==
  * Run the headless script:
    cd build.x86_64
    build.sh 

Enjoy,
